# Foothill Machine Learning & Data Science Club

Hello!

Thank you so much for coming to the meetings! This is where I will be posting lecture notes, codes, and solutions to different problems! If you have any questions, feel free to email me at Foothill.mlds@gmail.com.

Lectures and workshops will generally be held on Tuesdays 12PM (specific dates TBD) during the Fall Quarter.
Thank you so much!
