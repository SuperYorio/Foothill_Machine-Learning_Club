Hello!
These are some of my favorite open sources to self-learn Machine Learning & Data Science!
Good luck on your path to become a master in data scientist ;)

1. Andrew Ng Machine Learning Courses (Coursera): https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
	This is by far the most popular and my favorite online source to learn ML as it goes through the theories and the applications! It is also available on YouTube!

2. Andrew Ng Deep Learning (YouTube): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w
   The class, in my opinion and also my favorite, focuses more on applications and techniques as oppose to the theoretical and mathematical knowledge. I also highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Deep Learning!

3. O'Reilly Media: As Foothill students, the college subscribes to many journals and medias so we can have
   free access to them. Go to "Foothill Library" on the Foothill College website > "Articles & Databases" > 
   Section "O" for O'Reilly Safari > Login > Yay! The O'Reilly Media has the best books for mastering data
   science!

4. Kaggle: They have a LOT of datasets that you can practice on, and you can also discuss and learn from other
   ML'ers on their public forums! A very useful website to challenge your abilities in applying ML Algorithms.

5. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: This is my FAVORITE book of all times.
   The author, Geron, was able to combine both the mathematical and theoretical portion with the application
   seamlessly. Good news: this book is now available to read for free on O'Reilly; follow the #3. and search
   for the title and you should have access to it!

I will continue to update the list as time moves on :)
