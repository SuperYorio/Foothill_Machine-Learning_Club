Hello!
These are some of my favorite open sources to self-learn Machine Learning & Data Science!
Good luck on your path to become a master data scientist ;)

open_source is "Free"
>> True

1. Andrew Ng Machine Learning Courses (Coursera): https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
	This is by far the most popular source to learn ML as it goes through the theories and the applications

3. O'Reilly Media: As Foothill students, the college subscribes to many journals and medias so we can have
   free access to them. Go to "Foothill Library" on the Foothill College website > "Articles & Databases" > 
   Section "O" for O'Reilly Safari > Login > Yay! The O'Reilly Media has the best books for mastering data
   science!

4. Kaggle: They have a LOT of datasets that you can practice on, and you can also discuss and learn from other
   ML'ers on their public forums! A very useful website to challenge your abilities in applying ML Algorithms.

I will continue to update the list as time moves on :)
The only non-free resource that I can whole-heartedly recommend: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, & TensorFlow"
by Aurelien Geron. This book covers the basics of ML to the core of neural networks. If you could master even
75% of the content, I feel like you could drop out and have a great career in data science (just an opinion don't follow it haha).
** Remember to purchase the 2nd version of the book! The first version is for TensorFlow v1. but TensorFlow v2. just got released
this year!!
